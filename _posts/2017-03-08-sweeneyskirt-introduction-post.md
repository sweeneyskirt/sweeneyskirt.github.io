Thank goodness for Jonathan McGlone! The GitHub guide for its Pages featue is missing some important information for those of us who are extraorinarily inexperienced with any kind of code work. Mr. McGlone's walkthrough fills in all the gaps, doesn't patronize, and is super easy to understand and follow!

So here I am! I have created a pages site, edited a .css file, and posted my first blog entry.
Feeling pretty cool.
