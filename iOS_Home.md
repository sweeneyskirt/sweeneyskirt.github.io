# iOS Mobile SDK 101 #

Paydiant's mobile SDKs expose all the functionality necessary to build a mobile app that interacts with the Paydiant platform to perform a variety of complex mobile commerce operations.

The power of the Paydiant platform lies in its great flexibility, allowing partners to interact in a way that supports existing business processes, leverages existing third-party service relationships, and incorporates features and processes consistent with the vertical industry.

However, such flexibility means there are many different options for implementing a single objective, such as mobile app authentication, which can be overwhelming.

This quick starter guide, in conjunction with Paydiant's mobile SDK Sample Apps, aims to coach new developers in building a simple, functional mobile wallet app that can make a secure mobile payment through the Paydiant platform. The minimum functional requirements include:

1. [Set up a Development Environment](/ios_sdk_101/iOS_SetupDevEnv.md) 
1. [Provide Wallet Access](/ios_sdk_101/iOS_AccessWallet.md)
1. [Connect Wallet with Payment Methods](/ios_sdk_101/iOS_AddTenders.md)
